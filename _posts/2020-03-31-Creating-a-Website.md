This is interesting.

I know a little bit (a _really little_ bit) about HTML from some intro coding classes that I took back in high school, so I'm not completely in the dark here - just mostly in the dark.

My goal for this website is for it to serve as a basic intro to who I am and the things that I do - including my CV, contact information, links to any writing or anything else that I create, and so on. Think of this as step one towards building a personal brand.

To that end, what is it, exactly, that I'm trying to make here? Ideally, something that has a number of sections to capture all of the above, and the ability to add posts to a particular one as needed. Right now, it seems like I've got things set up to be able to create blog posts and not a whole lot else. So, how do I go about fixing that?
